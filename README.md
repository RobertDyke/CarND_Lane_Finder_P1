# CarND_Lane_Finder_P1
Project 1 CarND class
   This was the first project from the Udacity Self Driving Car class. It is in Python (my first Python project) on Jupyter Notebook (another first).
   It takes in several still images of roads and identifies the lanes correctly. It also takes in a video and correctly identifies the lanes in it. Cool stuff.
